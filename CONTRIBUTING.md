## Contributing to The Agony Engine

If you'd like to contribute code, here's how to get started.

1. Look in the GitHub issues for anything similar to what you'd like to do. We tend to have lots of issues labeled "help wanted" and/or "good first issue", and those are great ways to get started on your first contribution. If you have an idea that isn't covered already, feel free to open a new issue on GitHub and describe what you'd like to do. Please be prepared to discuss new ideas for features with the project maintainer(s) before you put too much work into them. We do reserve the right to reject ideas that do not fit with the project vision and goals.
1. Fork the project if you haven't already and get your local development environment set up as described [on the wiki](https://github.com/scionaltera/agony-engine/wiki/Local-Development).
1. Make your changes and test them.
1. Try to follow the existing code style as best as possible. Be sure to write unit tests that cover your new code.
1. When you're ready, submit a pull request. The project maintainers will take a look and possibly suggest some changes. When it's good to go, they'll merge it into master for you.

If you get stuck or have questions, feel free to submit a pull request even if your code isn't working. Just write a comment saying you're looking for help and someone will take a look and try to help you out. Collaborating with other developers is a great way for everyone to learn, and to get past difficult problems.
