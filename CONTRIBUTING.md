## Contributing to The Agony Engine

If you'd like to contribute code, here's how to get started.

1. Look in the GitHub issues for anything similar to what you'd like to do. If there is nothing, feel free to open a new issue. It's best to discuss new features and get the OK before spending a lot of time working on a contribution. It's best to avoid duplicate efforts and spending time on things that aren't in line with the vision for the project.
1. Once you have an issue assigned to you, fork the project if necessary and get your local development environment set up as described [on the wiki](https://github.com/scionaltera/agony-engine/wiki/Local-Development). Make your changes and test them.
1. Try to follow the existing code style as best as possible. Be sure to write unit tests that cover your new code.
1. When you're ready, submit a pull request. The project maintainers will take a look and possibly suggest some changes. When it's good to go, they'll merge it into master for you.

If you get stuck or have questions, feel free to submit a pull request even if your code isn't working. Just write a comment saying you're looking for help and someone will take a look and try to help you out. Collaborating with other developers is a great way for everyone to learn, and to get past difficult problems.
